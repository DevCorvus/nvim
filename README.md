# Neovim configuration

My first and only nvim config, probably the worst one out there. Highly inspired in ThePrimeagen's config but sullied with my sinful plugins.

> Fun fact: While making this config for the first time, I accidentally deleted my entire `.config` directory with a vim command (when it was almost completed), not only the nvim directory. It was kinda traumatic but anyways, here we are.
